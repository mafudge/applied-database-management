# Applied Database Management

Welcome!  

This website is dedicated to the textbook **Applied Database Management** and supplemental resources required to teach or learn with the book. I realize there are many options out there for learning database design and SQL and I thank you in advance for considering my course. The goal of **Applied Database Management** has always been more than just a textbook, but and entire suite of resources that make it easy for you to teach and learn this subject!

Best,
